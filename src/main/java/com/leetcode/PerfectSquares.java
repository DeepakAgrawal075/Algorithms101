 * 279. Perfect Squares
 * Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n.
 * A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
 * For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.
